To run the simple system, go to COMP0022 folder on terminal and run the following: - docker-compose build
                                                                                   - docker-compose up
                                                                                  
The system currently creates a mysql image, then creates a database, adds some data and the python container retrieves these data by accessing the mysql database and 
prints the retrieved data on the terminal
